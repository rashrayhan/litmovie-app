Schema design
-	We have decided to use two schemas model for our project named evote_detail and citizens
-	According to our design, we will be holding information about a city. Where the city will have the following main components:
	Population: number of people living in the city
	Voters: number of people are eligible to vote
	Citizens: an array a foreign key that connects the citizen schema with evote_schema
	Counties:holds an array of county objects which have basic information about county like:
o	Name
o	Location
o	Nominees in the county: nominee will hold information about the nominee like general information, vote counts and political party info
o	Polling sites: has an address with longitude and latitude to specify the location
